# SUPPA_supplementary_data
================================================

Supplementary data from:

"Fast and accurate differential splicing analysis across multiple conditions with replicates"
Juan C. Entizne, Juan L. Trincado, Gerald Hysenaj, Babita Singh, Miha Skalic, David J. Elliott, Eduardo Eyras

The supplementary_data is stuctured in the following way:

  - annotation/: Ensembl and RefSeq files from hg19 and mm10 used for the quantification
  - supplementary_data/busskamp: Commands used and events obtained with SUPPA, analyzing 4-day time-course data for the differentiation of human iPS cells into bipolar neurons¹
  - supplementary_data/erythro: Commands used and events obtained comparing initial and final steps of differentiating human erythroblasts²
  - supplementary_data/jurkat: Commands used and events obtained in the analysis of stimulated and unstimulated Jurkat T-cells³
  - supplementary_data/mouse: Commands used and events obtained in the analyzed data from Cerebellum and Liver mouse tissues covering 8 different time points from 2 full circadian cycles⁴
  - supplementary_data/simulated_reads: Commands and files necessary for the generation of the simulated reads, with 3 replicates of control cells from Best, A. et al⁵
  - supplementary_data/tra2: Commands used and events obtained in the analysis on knockdown of TRA2A and TRA2B splicing regulators compared to controls⁵
